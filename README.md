### Job-Recommendation-systemusing-machine-learning
This repository implements a powerful job recommendation system that analyzes resumes (PDF format) to extract relevant skills and match them to job descriptions.

Key Features:

PDF Text Extraction: Efficiently extracts text from PDF resumes using the pymupdf library.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Leverages spaCy's en_core_web_sm model to identify skills from extracted text, focusing on organization and product entities.
Clear Output: Presents the extracted skills in a user-friendly, comma-separated format.
Getting Started

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed (python3 --version).

Install Dependencies:

Bash
pip install pymupdf spacy
Use code with caution.

Download the required spaCy model (en_core_web_sm) automatically:

Bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Use code with caution.

Run the Code:

Bash
python job_recommendation.py
Use code with caution.

This script assumes your resume is located at /kaggle/input/shubhamsresume/Shubham Kumar (2).pdf. Update the path if needed.

Explanation:

The job_recommendation.py script performs the following steps:

PDF Text Extraction:
Imports pymupdf and opens the provided PDF file.
Iterates through each page and extracts the text.
Skill Extraction:
Imports spaCy and loads the en_core_web_sm model.
Processes the extracted text using spaCy's NER.
Identifies and filters for skills represented by organization and product entities.
Returns the extracted skills as a comma-separated string.
Output:
Prints the extracted skills to the console.
Customization:

Modify the script to tailor it to your specific needs, such as:
Adding support for different file formats.
Expanding the skill recognition criteria (e.g., include tools, technologies).
Implementing a job recommendation engine that matches extracted skills to job descriptions.
Further Exploration:

Explore advanced spaCy features for more precise skill extraction.
Integrate the code into a larger job search or career management application.
